The Magic Mike's Last Dance actor – who <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>recently reunited</a>&nbsp;</strong>with<strong>&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The Rookie star</a></strong> in order to cheer their nine-year-old on in a dance competition – discussed his experience as a single parent during an interview with <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Hoda Kotb</a></strong> and <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jenna Bush Hager</a></strong> on their show, Today with Hoda and Jenna.</p><p id=ekqE_lOr5iJf data-wc=40>"I didn’t plan to be a single dad," the 43-year-old actor admitted after he was asked about his parenting experience. "That was not in the cards [or] in my planning at the least. And I was pretty nervous," he admitted.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Catch up with the trailer for Channing Tatum's latest Magic Mike movie</figure><p id=eYOw_DE4Xe-G data-wc=44>The Alabama-born star continued honestly: "I was like, ‘She’s a girl.’ I was looking up on YouTube how to braid her hair.

As he explained to the <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Today</a></strong> hosts, writing this series of books has greatly helped the actor with his journey as a father. "This series of books kind of came from [this nervousness]," he said.

Speaking to <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a></strong> earlier in a June 2 interview about this moment from their past, Channing explained: "It was eating her up that she took it. She was so nervous to tell me, she didn't wanna tell me…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fa5588bd46b2-channing-tatum-struggles-single-father.jpg><p id=eLI5YT5ye1tw data-wc=66>"She felt so bad about it," he continued: "But then when she told me she felt better and we returned the little toy car." This inspired the Hollywood actor to make the focus of his next book Sparkella discovering "that the burden of carrying [a lie] is worse than just accepting it and apologizing for it," as many young children come to realize as they grow.</p><p id=etKf6dQ9sm data-wc=13><strong>SEE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Salma Hayek stuns in flirty dress for birthday dance with Channing Tatum</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=efi4ebrovR_8 data-wc=51>Revealing more about his relationship with Everly in his Today interview, Channing said: "We have a good relationship," before later also opening up about her interests now as a nine-year-old.
