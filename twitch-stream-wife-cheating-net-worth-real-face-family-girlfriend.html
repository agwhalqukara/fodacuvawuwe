If you want to find out, then stay with us for a while, as we are about to reveal all the juicy details about this famous gamer, including his cheating scandal.</p><p>Born Herschel Beahm IV on the 10th March 1982, in Encinitas, California USA, he came to prominence by streaming gameplay of such games as H1Z1, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, among others on Twitch, on which he has more than 2.5 million followers.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcewf3yAgGe/</p><h2><span id=DrDisRespect_Wiki_Early_Life_Parents_and_Education>DrDisRespect Wiki: Early Life, Parents, and Education</span></h2><p>There isn’t much information about Dr. DisRespect’s childhood, such as names of his parents and whether he has any siblings or not, however, it is known that he received a degree from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, during which time he also played basketball for the university team, competing in Division II NCAA league.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>As early as January 2010, Dr. DisRespect became known to the world, but first by his real name – the alias Dr. DisRespect was added later. He started by playing Halo 2 on the Xbox competing with other players, using voice chat and speaking aggressively to other players, and thanks to his great playing skills, he became a worthy opponent. With his roommates, Beahm started a YouTube channel “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Dr DisRespect</a>” on the 5th January 2010, with his first video “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Dr DisRespect Gaming: The Docs Very 1st Video</a>”, posted on the 11th January. Since then he has gained over 700,000 subscribers, and his videos have attracted more than 29 million views. As he continued to upload videos, DrDisRespect became more popular, his videos featuring in the popular web show “Machinima”. However, he left YouTube in 2011 and didn’t post anything more until 2016.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Also in 2011, he became a community manager of Sledgehammer Games, and ultimately reached the position of designer, helping design several maps for the popular game “Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare”. However, once he became popular on Twitch, he left Sledgehammer.</p><h2><span id=Twitch_Career>Twitch Career</span></h2><p>DrDisRespect became popular even before Twitch was founded; he opened his channel on Justin.tv, which later became Twitch, and started uploading videos of himself playing various battle royale games, particularly focusing on H1Z1, and later switching to PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds. He has now gained more than 2.5 million followers, becoming extremely popular. He took a hiatus back in late 2017, but returned to streaming in February 2018, and with his first video attracted 388,000 concurrent viewers, which at the time was a record. Pretty impressive don’t you think?</p><h2><span id=DrDisrespect_Net_Worth>DrDisrespect Net Worth</span></h2><p>Do you know how rich DrDisrespect is? Although he is not considered a professional gamer, as he is more focused on the funny part of the game, he still earns a significant sum for his efforts. So, as of late 2018, according to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Dr DisRespect’s net worth is as high as $800,000.
